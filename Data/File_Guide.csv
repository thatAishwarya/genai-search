Case I charges tax in respect of any trade and in respect of profits/gains arising out of lands, etc used for quarrying, mining, waterworks, docks, fishing, tolls, ferries, fairs, markets, etc. Case II charges tax in respect of any profession not contained in any other Schedule. Case III charges tax on — • interest, annuities and other annual payments, excluding any payment chargeable under Case V (in effect the Case III charge only arises where the interest, annuity or other annual payment is not liable to Irish tax at source); • profits from discount transactions (a discount arises on the purchase/sale of Government stock, promissory notes, bills of exchange, and the Case III charge arises on the difference between the cost of the instrument and the amount realised (3) (1)1 (1)1(a)(i) (1)1(a)(ii) (1)1(a)(iii) (1)1(a)(iv) (1)1(b) (1)1 (1)2 (2) 6 Notes for Guidance – Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 – Finance Act 2023 Edition - Part 2 on sale or maturity.

In the case of a foreign employment, the Case III charge does not include earnings (including any amount in the form of expenses payments received or benefits-in-kind derived) from the employment to the extent that those earnings are attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of the employment. Such earnings are, by virtue of paragraph 2 of Schedule D and paragraph 3 of Schedule E, chargeable to tax under Schedule E. The Case III charge on interest from foreign securities and income from foreign possessions is modified in the case of non-domiciled persons and Irish citizens not ordinarily resident in the State so that the charge is confined to the sums actually remitted to the State (see section 71). It should also be noted that certain foreign pensions are exempt from the Case III charge where the pension would have been exempt from tax in the country of origin had the person receiving it continued to reside in that country (section 200). The Case III charge is extended by section 55 to gains on strips of securities where a Case I charge does not arise and by section 57 to benefits in kind received in respect of foreign employments Case IV charges tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not within any other Case of Schedule D and not charged by virtue of any other Schedule. Income, etc within the Case IV charge may be divided into 2 categories, namely, the miscellaneous income not within any other Case or Schedule and the income statutorily directed to be charged under Case IV. Income within the first category has been decided by case law. Examples include profits of a casual nature, profits from hire of moveable assets (for example, farmer hiring machinery for isolated jobs), letting of premises where landlord/tenant relationship does not exist (for example, halls for dances, meetings, etc), shipping fees, green fees, casual literary fees, certain copyright royalties. Instances where a Case IV charge has been imposed by statute include profits from unlawful activities (section 58), income from which tax is deducted at source (section 59), post-cessation receipts of a trade/profession (section 91), mining rents and gains from dealings in leases and conveyances (Chapter 8 of Part 4), DIRT interest (Chapter 3 of Part 8), certain balancing charges (Part 9), refunds of pension contributions and excessive commutation payments under pension schemes (Chapter 1 of Part 30), withdrawal of various tax reliefs (for example, BES/film relief, etc), various anti-avoidance provisions countering the transfer of assets abroad, conversion of income into capital and schemes connected with the payment of interest on loans (Part 33), maintenance payments (section 1025). 7 Notes for Guidance – Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 – Finance Act 2023 Edition - Part 2 Case V charges tax on rent in respect of land or premises in the State and on receipts for easements (that is, any right, privilege or benefit in, over or derived from any land or premises in the State such as the right to erect advertising boards).","[6,7,8]",How is tax under schedule E charged?,"Tax under Schedule E is charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit and in respect of every annuity, pension or stipend payable out of the public revenue of the State (apart from annuities charged under Schedule C).

Similarly, where a company ceases to carry on a trade or to be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of a trade, the company’s income is computed as if the trade were discontinued at that point even though it may thereafter be carried on by someone else. This rule does not apply where there is specific provision that a trade is not to be treated as permanently discontinued. An example of such a case is that provided for in section 303(3) which secures, in relation to capital allowances for expenditure on dredging, that a balancing allowance is given only on the actual discontinuance of the trade involved as distinct from a change of ownership which for assessment purposes is treated as a permanent discontinuance.",[51]

A “deposit return” will be treated for all tax purposes as if it were “relevant interest” paid on a deposit of money and the provisions of Chapter 4 of Part 8 (deposit interest retention tax) will apply to the return.

(1) The income, profit, gains or losses arising from the underlying asset in an “investment transaction” will be regarded as income, profits, gains or losses of the certificate issuing company and that company will be chargeable to Corporation Tax accordingly. (2) The certificate owner will not be entitled to capital allowances on the underlying assets in the transaction.",[8],What does part8a cover in the FCA 1997?,"Part 8A provides a regime to tax certain Islamic financial transactions in the same way as conventional financial transactions. The term Islamic finance refers to financial transactions that are consistent with the principles of Islamic law (Shari’a). One of the main principles of Islamic finance is that the payment and receipt of interest (riba) is forbidden. Islamic financial transactions are typically backed by, or based on, an identifiable and tangible underlying asset, and involve risk sharing between the investor and the investee. To facilitate commercial transactions, Islamic financial structures have been devised that comply with the basic principles of Shari’a law. These products meet the same economic needs as conventional financial products by using familiar legal structures in an alternative way (insofar as debt is concerned) to achieve the financing objectives. Part 8A provides for the tax treatment of certain credit sale, deposit and investment transactions (referred to in the legislation as “specified financial transactions”) which achieve the same economic result in substance as comparable conventional products. Although designed to cover certain Shari’a compliant structures, the legislation applies to any financing arrangement falling within the meaning of the term “specified financial transaction” regardless of whether the arrangement is, in fact, Shari’a compliant. Effectively, the provisions treat the return arising on a specified financial transaction as interest for tax purposes and apply all relevant tax legislation pertaining to interest to that return.

(4) These obligations require each participant under contract with the company — • to permit his/her shares to remain in the hands of the trustees throughout the period of retention, • not to assign, charge or otherwise dispose of his/her beneficial interest in his/her shares during that period, • to pay to the trustees, before a transfer of ownership takes place, a sum equal to the amount of the locked-in value multiplied by the standard rate of income tax, if the participant directs the trustees to transfer ownership of the shares to him/her at any time before the release date, not to direct the trustees to dispose of his/her shares at any time before the release
date other than for sale for the best consideration in money that can be obtained at
the time of sale.
The obligation to pay a sum equal to income tax at the standard rate imposed on a person
who directs the trustees to transfer ownership of the shares to him/ her before the release
date is not to be construed as binding his/her personal representatives to pay any sum to
the trustees. It should be noted that, if a participant dies while the trustees are holding
scheme shares on his/her behalf, the period or retention comes to an end immediately even
if the shares have been held for less than 3 years. The tax charge is confined to disposals
made before the release date or, if it is earlier, before the date of the participant’s death.
Accordingly, a participant’s personal representatives can dispose of the shares
immediately and no part of the sale proceeds will attract liability to income tax.","[6,7]"

The expression “business of dealing in or developing land” is not defined and is to be construed according to its ordinary meaning as applied to the subject matter with regard to which it is used. In a case in which the existence of a business of dealing in or developing land has been established, the subsection is concerned only with the activities (if any) of the business which, under the general law, cannot be regarded as trading. In regard to such activities it calls for the determination of the question: would those activities have fallen to be treated as trading activities if every disposal of an interest in land included among those activities had been a disposal of the full interest acquired by the person by whom the business is carried on – and that interest had been acquired by the person in the course of the business? Where this question is answered in the affirmative, the business is deemed to be wholly a trade, or part of a trade, as the case may be, and the profits charged under Case I of Schedule D. Broadly, the effect of the subsection is that the question whether a given complex of activities involving the turning over of an interest in land constitutes trading in the Schedule D sense is to be determined as if — • the granting of a lease wholly or partly in consideration of a premium were a sale, and • the operator had acquired the interest in the land concerned with the intention of carrying out the operations and transactions which the operator did in fact carry out.",[4],What reliefs from corportation tax are provided in respect of income from dealing in residential development land?,"income from the disposal by companies of residential development land is to be taxed at 20 per cent.

Prior to 1 January 2019, farmers could not avail of income averaging where the farmer or their spouse/civil partner, carried on another trade or profession, unless that trade or profession related to on-farm diversification conducted on the farmland. In addition, a farmer could not elect for averaging if the farmer, or the farmer’s spouse/civil partner, was a director of a company carrying on a trade or profession and the farmer, or the farmer’s spouse/civil partner, was the beneficial owner or was able to control, either directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the ordinary share capital of the company. Finance Act 2018 removed these restrictions with effect from 1 January 2019. Once an election for averaging is made, a farmer must remain on averaging for a minimum of 3 years. If the farmer wishes to revert to the normal basis of assessment, the 2 years of assessment immediately before the final year of averaging are reviewed and, if necessary, additional assessments are made to ensure that the amount charged for each of those 2 years is not less than the amount charged for the final year of averaging. For the years of assessment 2015 onwards the period of income averaging is increased from three to five years. For the years of assessment 2015 onwards a farmer must remain on averaging for a
minimum of 5 years. If the farmer wishes to revert to the normal basis of assessment, the
4 years of assessment immediately before the final year of averaging are reviewed.
Special transitional measures are provided for those farmers who elect to opt out of
averaging in 2015 and 2016.
For the years of assessment 2016 onwards, a farmer may elect to step-out of the income
averaging regime, and revert to the normal basis of assessment, for a single year.
An option is given to farmers to step out of income averaging for the year of assessment
2020, notwithstanding that the farmer may also have stepped out of income averaging in
one of the four preceding tax years.
In the case of a farmer entering a Registered Farm Partnership which might otherwise

The intention behind tonnage tax is to provide a number of real advantages for all shipping companies which enter the regime. These include: • Certainty, since the level of tax will be known and minimal. This reduces the need for a company to make provision in its accounts for deferred taxation, thereby increasing earnings per share. • Flexibility, since companies will have more freedom to choose when to buy ships and how to finance them. These decisions will now largely be determined by commercial rather than tax considerations. • Clarity, a company’s tax position will now be more readily understood, consequently the company may become more attractive to investors and potential business partners. • Finally, compatibility and competitiveness with the fiscal regimes of other countries.

Effectively, such a beneficiary is taxable on his/her share of the residuary estate income for each of the tax years in the administration period by reference to the income arising from the date of death onwards. However, no assessment can be made on such a person before the end of the administration period unless and to the extent that sums have been paid on account of his/her absolute interest. At the end of the administration period, he/she is assessed on any balance of the residuary estate income not previously assessed. Section 802 contains provisions supplementary to this section. It should be noted that, where an estate which is small and is a straightforward one (for example, only one or two residuary beneficiaries with no annuitants, life tenants or other persons with an entitlement to any of the income of the estate) the inspector may adapt an approach simpler to that provided for in this section and tax the residuary beneficiary directly on all the income of the estate received from death onwards. In such cases no assessments are made on the personal representative and the beneficiary is taxed each year as if he/she had received the estate income from its various sources directly himself or herself.",[5],"How is the residuary income of an estate calculated for tax purposes, and what adjustments are made for beneficiaries receiving benefits from the estate?","The residuary income of an estate for any year of assessment is the aggregate income of the estate for that year reduced by — (1) • any annual interest, annuity or other annual payment which is a charge on the residue, • any expenses incurred by the personal representatives in the management of the assets of the estate, to the extent that they are properly chargeable to income, • any income to which a beneficiary has become entitled to during the course of the administration under a specific disposition or will become entitled to under a contingent or a vested interest when the administration period is completed. The “benefits received” by a residuary beneficiary in respect of an absolute interest in the residue mean the total of all sums paid (either before the completion of the administration period or on completion of that period) less income tax deducted at the standard rate. In the case of a foreign estate, the benefits received is the amount of such sums without deduction of income tax. Where the benefits or advances made to a beneficiary in respect of his/her share in the residue during the course of the administration exceed the amount of the total of the residuary income at the completion of the administration period, the beneficiary’s residuary income is proportionately adjusted for the tax years of the administration period. (2) If a beneficiary, other than the ultimate beneficiary at the close of the administration period, had an interest in the residue during the administration period, the residuary income of both beneficiaries is aggregated together to see whether an apportionment as set out in subsection (2) above is needed.",[6]

It is aimed at the foreign employment earnings of those persons who only spend part of a tax year in the State but who are, nevertheless, resident in the State in that year by reference to the rules of residence. It applies, therefore, to persons making a permanent move to or from the State during the course of a tax year. Thus, in the case of a person moving to the State, the treatment afforded by the section is only to apply where the person is likely to be resident in the State in the following year. Likewise, where a person is moving from the State, it is only to apply where the person will not be resident in the following year. Since these persons may be resident for the year of arrival or departure, they would consequently be taxable on any foreign earnings earned either before arrival in, or after departure from, the State. To ensure that this does not happen and to preserve previous administrative treatment, the section provides that in these cases residence is deemed to commence only on the date of arrival in the State or cease from the date of departure from the State. The effect of this is to attribute non-residence to that part of a tax year for which the person is not in the State.

Transfer pricing rules apply to certain arrangements between persons who are associated.
This section deals with the meaning of “associated”.
Details
Persons are associated if one person participates in the management, control or capital of
another person or the same person is participating in the management, control or capital of
both persons. The controlled person in each case must be a company. Associated persons
are mainly companies but, for example, an individual who is a controlling shareholder of a
company could be an associated person of that company.
(1)
A company will be treated as controlled by an individual if it is controlled by the individual
and persons connected with the individual. A person is connected with an individual if that
person is a “relative” of that individual within the meaning of section 433(3)(a).

A person is treated as entitled to acquire voting power, share capital or rights if that person is entitled to acquire those things in the future or will at a future date be entitled to acquire. (2) The rights or powers of a nominee of a person are attributable to the person on whose behalf the nominee has those rights or powers.

This is an important concept as it is the starting point for the calculation of EBITDA, upon which any interest limitation will be based. The definition refers to an amount of profits on which corporation tax falls finally to be borne, which in accordance with section 4 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, is a reference to the amount of those profits after making all deductions and giving all reliefs that for the purposes of corporation tax are made or given from or against those profits, including deductions and reliefs which under any provision are treated as reducing them for those purposes.

As the exceeding borrowing costs consists of amounts which have been grossed up to take account of income and expenses taxable and deductible at different tax rates, those amounts must be grossed back down for the purposes of assessing whether the de minimis threshold has been breached. (2) Subject to the rules pertaining to interest groups and where this section applies, the tax payable, or the amount of the tax loss where there is no tax payable, by a relevant entity will be calculated by reducing the amount of interest equivalent that would have been deducted but for this Part by the disallowable amount, until such time as the disallowable amount has been exhausted. (3) Where interest equivalent would have been deducted from profits chargeable to corporation tax at 25%, or treated as reducing the corporation tax payable on profits chargeable corporation tax at 25%, then the amount by which the interest equivalent will be reduced by the disallowable amount in accordance with subsection (3) is calculated by multiplying the disallowable amount by 12.5% divide by 25% i.e. as the disallowable amount has a tax value of 12.5%, it must be grossed back down for the purposes of reducing the amount of interest equivalent that is deducted from profits chargeable to corporation tax at the 25% rate. (4) Where interest equivalent is deducted from chargeable gains taxable at the ‘CGT rate’, then the amount by which the interest equivalent will be reduced by the disallowable amount in accordance with subsection (3) is calculated by multiplying the disallowable amount by 12.5% divided by the applicable ‘CGT rate’ i.e. as the disallowable has a tax value of 12.5%, it must be grossed back down for the purposes of reducing the amount of interest equivalent that is deducted from chargeable gains taxable at the ‘CGT rate’.",[9],Under what conditions must a debt owed to associated enterprises be included when calculating the equity ratio over total assets for a single company worldwide group?,"Provides that in calculating the ratio of equity over total assets for a single company

(a) the relevant entity’s equity ratio is no lower than two percentage points
below the worldwide group’s equity ratio based on the ultimate
consolidated financial statements of the worldwide group in which the
relevant entity’s accounting period ends, or

group, where the relevant entity’s equity ratio is no lower than two
percentage points below the single company worldwide group’s equity
ratio based on the financial statements in which the relevant entity’s

If, in the last 6 months of an accounting period, a scheme or arrangement is put in place
which results in an increase in the equity of the relevant entity, the effect of that scheme
or arrangement will be ignored for the purposes of calculating the relevant entity’s ratio
of equity over total assets for that accounting period unless it can be shown that the

","This new scheme known as “Special Savings Incentive Accounts” (SSIAs) commenced on the 1st of May 2001 and every eligible person is entitled to start such an account during the following 12 months. The main features of the scheme are as follows — • every resident person who is aged 18 or over can have an account, but only one account – it will be a criminal offence to have more than one account; • in the first year of the account the person must save an amount agreed with the managing institution; this amount cannot be less than €12.50, and not more than €254, in any one month; • after the first year there is no obligation to save a fixed regular amount but in any one month, the amount saved cannot exceed €254; • the incentive to save, which the scheme provides, is that for every €1 saved in an account, the Exchequer will contribute 25 cent to the account – this is equivalent to giving a tax credit (at the standard rate of income tax for the year of assessment 2001) in respect of the amount saved; this tax credit is forwarded to the managing institution for lodgement into the account; • special savings incentive accounts are managed on behalf of the individual saver by a range of bodies such as banks, building societies, credit unions and life assurance companies; the manager invests the saver’s lodgements together with the Exchequer tax credit by putting them on deposit, or investing in shares, government securities, units of a unit trust or a life assurance policy; • it is possible for a saver to transfer his/her account from one manager to another; • if a savings account runs its full term of 5 years or the account holder dies the account is treated as maturing and only the investment gain will suffer tax, and then at only 23 per cent – in other words the amount saved and the total Exchequer contribution will then belong to the saver tax free; • if, however, there is a withdrawal from the account, before it has run its full term, the amount withdrawn will suffer tax at 23 per cent; • some conditions attach to the scheme; e.g. a declaration must be completed on commencing the account to include the individual’s Personal Public Service Number; the individual must be resident in the State for tax purposes, etc; if any such condition is not adhered to, or the account is terminated before it matures, it is treated as ceasing and the total amount in the account will be taxed at 23 per cent",[2],How is the tax credit for Special Savings Incentive Accounts (SSIAs) claimed and paid to the account holders?,Tax credit payment mechanism The mechanism by which the tax credit is obtained is that the savings manager makes a return to the Revenue Commissioners within 15 days of the end of each month to claim the tax credits in respect of all that month’s subscriptions to SSIAs managed by the manager. The return also contains the aggregate of any tax deducted by the manager. The net amount due to the manager is claimed from and paid over by the Revenue Commissioners.

(2) Any reference in any document or enactment to a provision of the TCA 1997 is to be construed, where necessary, as a reference to the corresponding provision of the relevant legislation before consolidation. (3) Any reference in any document or enactment to a provision before consolidation (that is, a reference to a repealed enactment) is to be construed, where necessary, as a reference to the corresponding provision of the TCA 1997. (4) No act which was not an offence when it was committed or occurred is to be regarded as an offence in the period from 6 April, 1997 to 30 November, 1997 (the date of passing of the TCA 1997).",[4],What happens to the appointment and authorization of Revenue Commissioners' officers made before the TCA 1997?,"The appointment, authorisation and nomination of officers of the Revenue Commissioners and all instruments, documents, authorisations and letters of appointment made or issued before the commencement of the TCA 1997 continue in force as if made or issued under the TCA 1997.",[4]
Data/Ireland/TCA_FA2023_Sched.pdf,"Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (Finance Act 2023 Edition) Schedules",Under what conditions can a fund own more than 10% of the shares in a subsidiary without affecting its status as a distributing fund?,"In the absence of special provision, a fund which had a subsidiary company to perform management and dealing functions would fall foul of the condition in section 744(3)(c) by owing more than 10 per cent of the shares of a company. Relief is given to enable a fund to meet this condition in circumstances where it owns the whole of the issued share capital in a subsidiary whose business consists wholly of certain functions. par 12(1) If the subsidiary meets the requirements in subparagraph (2) or (3), the parent company’s interest in the subsidiary is disregarded in determining whether or not the former qualifies as a distributing fund. The subsidiary is disregarded if it is dealing in material interests in the parent fund for the purposes of and in connection with the management and administration of the fund’s business. The subsidiary must not be entitled to any distribution in respect of any material interest held by it for the time being. par 12(2) The subsidiary is disregarded if its business consists wholly of providing services for the fund, or for it and other offshore funds with an interest in the company. The services permitted are — par 12(3) & (4) • holding any property occupied or used in connection with the fund’s management or administration, and • providing administrative, management and advisory services to the fund. The subsidiary’s remuneration for these services must not exceed the commercial rate. The management subsidiary is itself permitted to have subsidiaries. If so, all references to the nature of its business, etc are to be taken as references to it and all of its subsidiaries.",[105],How does double tax relief apply when profits are transferred between foreign companies and then a dividend is paid to an Irish company?,"Provision is made for double tax relief in cases where the profits of one company become the profits of another company other than by the payment of a dividend. The relief applies where: par 9H • a foreign company (the first company) pays foreign tax in respect of its profits, • some or all of those profits become the profits of another foreign company (the second company) other than by the payment of a dividend, and • the second company pays a dividend to another company (either another foreign company or an Irish company) out of the profits. Where the conditions for obtaining relief are satisfied and the second company or another foreign company pays a dividend to an Irish company, credit (in accordance with the rules in Schedule 24) can be allowed to the Irish company in respect of the tax paid by the first company as if it had been paid by the second company. The extent of the relief is limited in two ways: • credit allowed to the Irish company is limited, where appropriate, to the amount that would have been due had the profits been transferred instead by way of a dividend, and • no relief is available where the profits transfer from the first company to the second company is part of a tax avoidance scheme.",[144],"Under what circumstances can the Revenue Commissioners withdraw approval from a trust, and what are the obligations of trustees regarding information provision?","The Revenue Commissioners have the right to withdraw approval in circumstances where — par 3(1) • one or more of the conditions in paragraphs 6 to 18 are contravened, • shares acquired by trustees receive different treatment from other shares of the same class (in particular, they must not receive different treatment in respect of dividend rights, repayment rights, restrictions attaching to the shares and bonus or rights issues), or • the trustees fail, on or after 24 December 2008, to provide information requested under paragraph 3(4) or information required to be delivered under paragraph 3(5). Withdrawal of approval may be effective on the first occurrence of such circumstance or such later time as the Revenue Commissioners may specify. An approval automatically ceases where there is an unapproved alteration to the terms of the trust. par 3(2) While shares acquired by the trust are to be accorded the same treatment in the matter of dividend rights as other shares of the same class, this is not to be taken as meaning that there are grounds for withdrawal of approval if newly issued shares do not rank for the next dividend on the same basis as shares of the same class already in issue. par 3(3) The Revenue Commissioners may request from any person such information as they think necessary to enable them determine whether to approve or withdraw approval of an ESOT and to determine a beneficiary’s tax liability under an ESOT. par 3(4) With effect from 2009 onwards, the trustees of a trust are obliged to automatically furnish the same information referred to in the above paragraph to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each calendar year. This return of information is required by 31 March in the year following the year in question. Failure to do so will result in penalties as set out in sections 1052 and 1054, as appropriate.",[32]
